She did her PhD thesis at INRIA in CFD using domain decomposition and parallel computing and subsequently became a research assistant at CMAP of Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. She got her first lecturer position at Evry University in Paris area, before moving to the University of Nice (now University Côte d’Azur). She also spent one year and a half as a visiting professor at the University of Geneva in Switzerland. Her research interests include the design of fast algorithms for the simulation of large scale complex systems of PDEs and scientific machine learning. Together with her collaborators, she was the recipient of Bull-Joseph Fourier Prize, delivered by Atos-Bull, for her innovative work on real time simulation of strokes using HPC (SIAM News, 2016). She co-authored a reference work on Domain decomposition methods (published by SIAM in 2015).</td>

He graduated from Chongqing Normal University in 1978 and completed his doctor’s degree in Institute of Applied Mathematics, CAS in 1984. Then he was elected Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences and the World Academy of Sciences in 1995 and 1998 successively, and he became the Fellow of Institute of Mathematical Statistics (IMS) in 2007. His contribution in the theory of Dirichlet forms and Markov processes brought an end to a twenty years puzzle in the field. Ma and his team discovered a new framework of quasi-regular Dirichlet forms which correspond to right processes in one-to-one manner.</td>
